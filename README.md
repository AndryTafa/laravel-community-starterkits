# Laravel Starterkits Gallery

A community-driven gallery for discovering Laravel 12's new community starter kits feature.

## Why this exists

With Laravel 12.2.0, the Laravel installer now supports community starter kits through the `laravel new --using` command. While this is a great feature, finding and evaluating different starter kits on GitHub can be time-consuming.

This platform aims to solve that by providing a central place to:
- Discover community starter kits
- See what others are building and using
- Share your own starter kits with the community

## Roadmap (not necessarily in order)

- [x] Basic starterkit gallery
- [x] Add filterable tags (e.g. vue, svelte, stripe...)
- [x] Bookmark favourites
- [x] Sort by number of bookmarks
- [ ] Transfer ownership from one user to another
